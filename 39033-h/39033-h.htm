<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It is now generally recognised that the old-fashioned method
of teaching machine drawing is very unsatisfactory. In
teaching by this method an undimensioned scale drawing,
often of a very elaborate description, is placed before the
student, who is required to <i>copy</i> it. Very often the student
succeeds in making a good copy of the drawing placed before
him without learning very much about the object represented
by it, and this state of matters is sometimes not much improved
by the presence of the teacher, who is often simply an art
master, knowing nothing about machine design. It is related
of one school that a pupil, after making a copy of a particular
drawing, had a discussion with his teacher as to whether the
object represented was a sewing machine or an electrical
machine. Evidently the publisher of the drawing example in
this case did not adopt the precaution which a backward
student used at an examination in machine design: he put on
a full title above his drawing, for the information of his
examiner.</p>

<p>Now, if machine drawing is to be of practical use to any
one, he must be able to understand the form and arrangement
of the parts of a machine from an inspection of suitable drawings
of them without seeing the parts themselves. Also he
ought to be able to make suitable drawings of a machine or
parts of a machine from the machine or the parts themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>In producing this work the author has aimed at placing
before young engineers and others, who wish to acquire the
skill and knowledge necessary for making the simpler <i>working
drawings</i> such as are produced in engineers' drawing offices, a
number of good exercises in drawing, sufficient for one session's
work, and at the same time a corresponding amount of information
on the design of machine details generally.</p>

<p>The exercises set are of various kinds. In the first and
simplest certain views of some machine detail are given, generally
drawn to a small scale, which the student is asked to reproduce
<i>to dimensions marked on these views</i>, and he is expected
to keep to these dimensions, and not to measure anything from
the given illustrations. In the second kind of exercise the
student is asked to reproduce certain views shown <i>to dimensions
given in words or in tabular form</i>. In the third kind of
exercise the student is required to make, in addition to certain
views shown to given dimensions, others which he can only
draw correctly if he thoroughly understands the design before
him. In the fourth kind of exercise the student is asked to
make the necessary working drawings for some part of a
machine which has been previously described and illustrated,
<i>the dimensions to be calculated by rules given in the text</i>.</p>

<p>The illustrations for this work are all new, and have been
specially prepared by the author from <i>working drawings</i>, and
he believes that they will be found to represent the best
modern practice.</p>

<p>As exercises in drawing, those given in this book are not
numbered exactly in their order of difficulty, but unless on the
recommendation of a teacher, the student should take them up
in the order given, omitting the following:&mdash;26, 27, 28, 35, 40,
42, 43, 45, 49, 50, 54, 60, 61, as he comes to them, until he has
been right through the book; afterwards he should work out
those which he omitted on first going over the book.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>
<p>In addition to the exercises given in this work the student
should practise making freehand sketches of machine details
from actual machines or good models of them. Upon these
sketches he should put the proper dimensions, got by direct
measurement from the machine or model by himself. These
sketches should be made in a note-book kept for the purpose,
and no opportunity should be lost of inserting a sketch of any
design which may be new to the student, always putting on
the dimensions if possible. These sketches form excellent
examples from which to make working drawings. The student
should also note any rules which he may meet with for proportioning
machines, taking care, however, in each case to state
the source of such information for his future guidance and
reference.</p>

<p>As machine drawing is simply the application of the
principles of descriptive geometry to the representation of
machines, the student of the former subject, if he is not
already acquainted with the latter, should commence to study
it at once.</p>

<h3><i>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</i></h3>

<p>To this edition another chapter has been added, containing a
number of miscellaneous exercises, which it is hoped will add
to the usefulness of the work as a text-book in science classes.
The latest examination paper in machine drawing by the
Science and Art Department has also been added to the
Appendix.</p>

<h1>AN INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h5>TO</h5>

<h1>MACHINE DRAWING AND DESIGN.</h1>



<hr style="width: 15%;" />
<h2>I. &nbsp; INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><i>Drawing Instruments.</i>&mdash;For working the exercises in this
book the student should be provided with the following:&mdash;A
well-seasoned yellow pine <i>drawing-board</i>, 24 inches long, 17
inches wide, and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thick, provided with cross-bars
on the back to give it strength and to prevent warping.
A <b>T</b> <i>square</i>, with a blade 24 inches long attached permanently
to the stock, <i>but not sunk into it</i>. One 45&deg; and one 60&deg; <i>set
square</i>. The short edges of the former may be about 6 inches
and the short edge of the latter about 5 inches long. A <i>pair
of compasses</i> with pen and pencil attachments, and having legs
from 5 inches to 6 inches long. A <i>pair of dividers</i>, with
screw adjustment if possible. A <i>pair of small steel spring
pencil bows</i> for drawing small circles, and a <i>pair of small steel
spring pen bows</i> for inking in the same. A <i>drawing pen</i> for
inking in straight lines. All compasses should have <i>round
points</i>, and if possible <i>needle</i> points. A piece of india-rubber
will also be required, besides two pencils, one marked H or HH
and one marked HB or F; the latter to be used for lining in
a drawing which is not to be inked in, or for freehand work.</p>

<p>Pencils for mechanical drawing should be sharpened with
a <i>chisel point</i>, and those for freehand work with a <i>round point</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<i>Do not wet the pencil</i>, as the lines afterwards made with it are
very difficult to rub out.</p>

<p>Drawing-paper for working drawings may be secured to
the board by <i>drawing-pins</i>, but the paper for finished drawings
or drawings upon which there is to be a large amount of
colouring should be <i>stretched</i> upon the board.</p>

<p>The student should get the best instruments he can afford
to buy, and he should rather have a few good instruments than
a large box of inferior ones.</p>

<p><i>Drawing-paper.</i>&mdash;The names and sizes of the sheets of
drawing paper are given in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='center'>Inches</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Demy</td><td align='left'>20 &times; 15</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Medium</td><td align='left'>22 &times; 17</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Royal</td><td align='left'>24 &times; 19</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Imperial</td><td align='left'>30 &times; 22</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Atlas</td><td align='left'>34 &times; 26</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Double Elephant &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='left'>40 &times; 27</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Antiquarian</td><td align='left'>52 &times; 31</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The above sizes must not be taken as exact. In practice
they will be found to vary in some cases as much as an inch.</p>

<p>Cartridge-paper is made in sheets of various sizes, and also
in rolls.</p>

<p>Hand-made paper is the best, but it is expensive. Good
cartridge-paper is quite suitable for ordinary drawings.</p>

<p><i>Centre Lines.</i>&mdash;Drawings of most parts of machines will be
found to be symmetrical about certain lines called <i>centre lines</i>.
These lines should be drawn first with great care. On a pencil
drawing centre lines should be thin continuous lines; in this
book they are shown thus &mdash; - &mdash; - &mdash;.</p>

<p>After drawing the centre line of any part the dimensions
of that part must be marked off from the centre line, so as to
insure that it really is the centre line of that part: thus in
making a drawing of a rivet, such as is shown at (<i>a</i>) fig. 1,
after drawing the centre line, half the diameter of the rivet
would be marked off on each side of that line, in order to
determine the lines for the sides of the rivet.</p>

<p><i>Inking.</i>&mdash;For inking in drawings the best Indian ink
should be used, and not common writing ink. Common ink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
does not dry quick enough, and rapidly corrodes the drawing
pens. The pen should be filled by means of a brush or a
narrow strip of paper, and not by dipping the pen into the ink.</p>

<p>In cases where there are straight lines and arcs of circles
touching one another <i>ink in the arcs first</i>, then the straight
lines; in this way it is easier to hide the joints.</p>

<p><i>Colouring.</i>&mdash;Camel's-hair or sable brushes should be used;
the latter are the best, but are much more expensive than the
former. The colour should be rubbed down in a dish, and the
tint should be light. The mistake which a beginner invariably
makes is in having the colour of too dark a tint.</p>

<p>First go over the part to be coloured with the brush and
<i>clean</i> water for the purpose of damping it. Next dry with
clean blotting-paper to take off any superfluous water. Then
take another brush with the colour, and beginning at the top,
work from left to right and downwards. If it is necessary to
recolour any part let the first coating dry before beginning.</p>

<p>Engineers have adopted certain colours to represent particular
materials; these are given in the following table:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Printing.</i>&mdash;A good drawing should have its title printed,
a plain style of letter being used for this purpose, such as the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus012a.png" width="800" height="388" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The following letters look well <i>if they are well made</i>, but
they are much more difficult to draw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus012b.png" width="800" height="188" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>For remarks on a drawing the following style is most suitable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus012.png" width="800" height="68" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>All printing should be done by freehand.</p>

<p><i>Border lines</i> are seldom put on engineering drawings.</p>

<p><i>Working Drawings.</i>&mdash;A good working drawing should be
prepared in the following manner. It must first be carefully
outlined in pencil and then inked in. After this all parts cut
by planes of section should be coloured, the colours used
indicating the materials of which the parts are made. Parts
which are round may also be lightly shaded with the brush
and colours to suit the materials. The centre lines are now
inked in with <i>red</i> or <i>blue ink</i>. The red ink may be prepared
by rubbing down the cake of crimson lake, and the blue ink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
in like manner from the cake of Prussian blue. Next come
the <i>distance</i> or <i>dimension</i> lines, which should be put in with
<i>blue</i> or <i>red ink</i>, depending on which colour was used for the
centre lines. Dimension lines and centre lines are best put in
of different colour. The arrow-heads at the ends of the
dimension lines are now put in with <i>black ink</i>, and so are the
figures for the dimensions. The arrow-heads and the figures
should be made with a common writing pen. The dimensions
should be put on neatly. Many a good drawing has its appearance
spoiled through being slovenly dimensioned.</p>

<p>We may here point out the importance of putting the
dimensions on a working drawing. If the drawing is not
dimensioned, the workman must get his sizes from the drawing
by applying his rule or a suitable scale. Now this operation
takes time, and is very liable to result in error. Time is
therefore saved, and the chance of error reduced, by marking
the sizes in figures.</p>

<p>In practice it is not usual to send original drawings from
the drawing office to the workshop, but copies only. The copies
may be produced by various 'processes,' or they may be tracings
drawn by hand. Many engineers do not ink in their
original drawings, but leave them in pencil; especially is this
the case if the drawings are not likely to be much used.</p>

<p><i>Scales.</i>&mdash;The best scales are made of ivory, and are twelve
inches long. Boxwood scales are much cheaper, although
not so durable as those made of ivory. If the student does
not care to go to the expense of ivory or boxwood scales, he
can get paper ones very cheap, which will be quite sufficient
for his purpose. The divisions of the scale should be marked
down to its edge, so that measurements may be made by applying
the scale directly to the drawing. For working such
exercises as are in this book the student should be provided
with the following scales:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>

<p>A scale of 1 is spoken of as 'full size,' and a scale of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> as
'half size.'</p>

<p>Engineers in this country state dimensions of machines in
feet, inches, and fractions of an inch, the latter being the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>, &amp;c. In making calculations it is generally more convenient
to use decimal fractions, and then substitute for the
results the equivalent fractions in eighths, sixteenths, &amp;c.

<h2>II. &nbsp; RIVETED JOINTS.</h2>


<p>Two plates or pieces to be riveted together have holes
punched or drilled in them in such a manner that one may be
made to overlap the other so that the holes in the one may be
opposite the holes in the other. The rivets, which are round
bars of iron, or steel, or other metal, are heated to redness
and inserted in the holes; the head already formed on the
rivet, and called the tail, is then held up, and the point is hammered
or pressed so as to form another head. This process of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
forming the second head on the rivet is known as riveting,
and may be done by hand-hammering or by a machine.</p>

<p><i>Forms of Rivet Heads.</i>&mdash;In fig. 1 are shown four different
forms of rivet heads: (<i>a</i>) is a <i>snap head</i>, (<i>b</i>) a <i>conical head</i>
(<i>c</i>) a <i>pan head</i>, and (<i>d</i>) <i>a countersunk head</i>.</p>

<p><i>Proportions of Rivet Heads.</i>&mdash;The diameter of the snap
head is about 1&middot;7 times the diameter of the rivet, and its height
about &middot;6 of the diameter of the rivet. The conical head has a
diameter twice and a height three quarters of the rivet
diameter. The greatest diameter of the pan head is about 1&middot;6,
and its height &middot;7 of the rivet diameter. The greatest diameter
of the countersunk head may be one and a half, and its depth
a half of the diameter of the rivet.</p>

<img src="images/illus015.jpg" width="800" height="353" alt="Fig. 1." title="Fig. 1." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.</span>
</div>

<p>In fig. 1 at (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are shown geometrical constructions
devised by the author for drawing the snap and conical head
for any size of rivet, the proportions being nearly the same as
those given above.</p>

<p><i>Geometrical Construction for Proportioning Snap Heads.</i>&mdash;With
centre A, and radius equal to half diameter of rivet,
describe a circle cutting the centre line of the rivet at B and C.
With centre B and radius BC describe the arc CD. Make
BE equal to AD. With centre E and radius ED describe the
arc DFH.</p>

<p><i>Construction for Conical Head.</i>&mdash;With centre K, and radius
equal to diameter of rivet, describe the semicircle LMN, cutting
the side of the rivet at M. With centre M and radius MN<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
describe the arc NP to cut the centre line of rivet at P. Join
PL and PN.</p>

<p>When a number of rivets of the same diameter have to be
shown on the same drawing the above constructions need only
be performed on one rivet. After the point E has been discovered
the distance AE may be measured off on all the other
rivets, and the arcs corresponding to DFH drawn with radii
equal to ED. In like manner the height KP of the conical
head may be marked off on all rivets of the same diameter
with conical heads.</p>

<p><i>Caulking.</i>&mdash;In order to make riveted joints steam- or water-tight
the edges of the plates and the edges of the heads of the
rivets are burred down by a blunt chisel or caulking tool as
shown at Q and R.</p>

steam boiler may not be bulged out by the pressure of the steam
they are strengthened by means of stays. One form of boiler stay,
called a 'gusset stay,' is shown in fig. 8. This stay consists of a
strip of wrought-iron plate which passes in a diagonal direction
from the flat end of the boiler to the cylindrical shell. One end of
this plate is placed between and riveted to two angle irons
which are riveted to the shell of the boiler. A similar arrangement
connects the other end of the stay plate to the flat end of the
boiler. In this example the stay or gusset plate is &frac34; of an inch
thick; the angle irons are 4 inches broad and &frac12; inch thick. The
rivets are 1 inch in diameter. The same figure also illustrates the
most common method of connecting the ends of a boiler to the
shell. The end plates are <i>flanged</i> or bent over at right angles and
riveted to the shell as shown. The radius of the inside curve at
the angle of the flange is 1&frac14; inches. Draw this example to a scale
of 3 inches to 1 foot.</p>

at (<i>c</i>). This form is principally used for transmitting motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 9.</span>
</div>

<p>Comparing the triangular and square threads, the former is
the stronger of the two; but owing to the normal pressure on
the <b>V</b> thread being inclined to the axis of the screw, that pressure
must be greater than the pressure which is being transmitted
by the screw; and therefore, seeing that the normal
pressure on the square thread is parallel, and therefore equal
to the pressure transmitted in the direction of the axis of the
screw, the friction of the <b>V</b> thread must be greater than the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>friction of the square thread. In the case of the triangular
thread there is also a tendency of the pressure to burst the
nut. The <i>Buttress</i> thread shown at (<i>e</i>) is designed to combine
the advantages of the <b>V</b> and square threads, but it only has
these advantages when the pressure is transmitted in one
direction; if the direction of the pressure be reversed, the
friction and bursting action on the nut are even greater than
with the <b>V</b> thread, because of the greater inclination of the
slant side of the buttress thread. The angles of the square
thread are frequently rounded to a greater or less extent to
render them less easily damaged. If this rounding is carried to
excess we get the <i>Knuckle</i> thread shown at (<i>d</i>). The rounding
of the angles increases both the strength and the friction.</p>

<p><i>Representation of Screws.</i>&mdash;The correct method of representing
screw threads involves considerable trouble, and is
seldom adopted by engineers for working drawings. For an
explanation of the method see the author's Text-book on
Practical Solid Geometry, Part II., problem 134. A method
very often adopted on working drawings is shown in fig. 15;
here the thin lines represent the points, and the thick lines
the roots of the threads. At fig. 16 is shown a more complete
method. The simplest method is illustrated by figs. 10, 11,
13, and 14.</p>

<p>Here dotted lines are drawn parallel to the axis of the
screw as far as it extends, and at a distance from one another
equal to the diameter of the screw at the bottom of the
thread.</p>

<p><i>Forms of Nuts.</i>&mdash;The most common form of nut is the
hexagonal shown in figs. 10, 13, 14, 15, and 16; next to this
comes the square nut shown in fig. 11. The method of drawing
these nuts will be understood by reference to the figures; the
small circles indicate the centres, and the inclined lines passing
through them the radii of the curves which represent the
chamfered or bevelled edge of the nut. In all the figures but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the first the chamfer is just sufficient to touch the middle
points of the sides, and in these cases the drawing of the nut is
simpler.</p>

<p><i>Forms of Bolts.</i>&mdash;At (<i>a</i>), fig. 12, is shown a bolt with a
square head and a square neck. If this form of bolt is passed
through a square hole the square neck prevents the bolt from
turning when the nut is being screwed up. Instead of a
square neck a snug may be used for the same purpose, as shown
on the cup-headed bolt at (<i>b</i>). The snug fits into a short
groove cut in the side of the hole through which the bolt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
passes. At (<i>a</i>) the diagonal lines are used to distinguish the
flat side of the neck from the round part of the bolt above
it. At (<i>c</i>) is shown a tee-headed bolt, and at (<i>d</i>) an eye-bolt.
Fig. 13 represents a hook bolt. A bolt with a countersunk head
is shown in fig. 11. If the countersunk head be lengthened so
as to take up the whole of the unscrewed part of the bolt, we
get the taper bolt shown in fig. 14, which is often used in the
couplings of the screw shafts of steamships. The taper bolt
has the advantage of having no projecting head, and it may
also be made a tight fit in the hole with less trouble than a
parallel bolt. Bolts may also have hexagonal heads.</p>

<p><i>Studs</i>, or <i>stud bolts</i>, are shown in figs. 15 and 16; that in
fig. 15 is a <i>plain stud</i>, while that in fig. 16 has an intermediate
collar forged upon it, and is therefore called a <i>collared stud</i>.</p>

<p><i>Proportions of Nuts and Bolt-heads.</i>&mdash;In the hexagonal nut
the diameter D across the flats is 1&frac12;<i>d</i> + <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>, where <i>d</i> is the
diameter of the bolt. The same rule gives the width of a
square nut across the flats. A rule very commonly used in
making drawings of hexagonal nuts is to make the diameter
D, across the angles equal to 2<i>d</i>. H, the height of the nut,
is equal to the diameter of the bolt. In square and hexagonal
headed bolts the height of the head varies from <i>d</i> to <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub><i>d</i>;
the other dimensions are the same as for the corresponding
nuts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Washers</i> are flat, circular, wrought-iron plates, having holes
in their centres of the same diameter as the bolts on which
they are used. The object of the washer is to give a smooth
bearing surface for the nut to turn upon, and it is used when
the surfaces of the pieces to be connected are rough, or when
the bolt passes through a hole larger than itself, as shown in
fig. 10. The diameter of the washer is a little more than the
diameter of the nut across the angles, and its thickness about
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of the diameter of the bolt.</p>

carries the guard D and an hexagonal nut E. F is the india-rubber.
The grating and guard are of brass. The stud and nut are of
wrought iron. Draw full size the view shown.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Lock Nuts.</i>&mdash;In order that a nut may turn freely upon a
bolt, there is always a very small clearance space between the
threads of the nut and those of the bolt. This clearance is shown
exaggerated at (<i>a</i>), fig. 17, where A is a portion of a bolt within
a nut B. Suppose that the bolt is stretched by a force W.
When the nut B is screwed up, the upper surfaces of the
projecting threads of the nut will press on the under surfaces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the threads of the bolt with a force P equal and opposite to
W, as shown at (<i>b</i>), fig. 17. When in this condition the nut
has no tendency to slacken back, because of the friction due to
the pressure on the nut. Now suppose that the tension W
on the bolt is momentarily diminished, then the friction which
opposes the turning of the nut may be so much diminished
that a vibration may cause it to slacken back through a small
angle. If this is repeated a great many times the nut may
slacken back so far as to become useless.</p>

<p>A very common arrangement for locking a nut is shown at
(<i>a</i>), fig. 18. C is an ordinary nut, and B one having half the
thickness of C. B is first screwed up tight so as to act on the
bolt, as shown at (<i>b</i>), fig. 17. C is then screwed on top of B.
When C is almost as tight as it can be made, it is held by one
spanner, while B is turned back through a small angle with
another. The action of the nuts upon the bolt and upon one
another is now as shown at (<i>b</i>), fig. 18. It will be seen that
the nuts are wedged tight on to the bolt, and that this action
is independent of the tension W in the bolt. The nuts will,
therefore, remain tight after the tension in the bolt is removed.</p>

<p>It is evident that if the nuts are screwed up in the manner
explained, the outer nut C will carry the whole load on the
bolt; hence C should be the thicker of the two nuts. In
practice, the thin nut, called the lock nut, is often placed on
the outside, for the reason that ordinary spanners are too
thick to act on the thin nut when placed under the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Another very common arrangement for locking a nut is
shown in fig. 19. A is the bolt and B the nut, the lower part
of which is turned circular. A groove C is also turned on the
nut at this part. The circular part of the nut fits into a
circular recess in one of the parts connected by the bolt.
Through this part passes a set screw D, the point of which can
be made to press on the nut at the bottom of the groove C. D
is turned back when the nut B is being moved, and when B
is tightened up, the set
screw is screwed up so as
to press hard on the bottom
of the groove C. The
nut B is thus prevented
from slackening back. The
screw thread is turned off
the set screw at the point
where it enters the groove
on the nut.</p>

<p>The use of the groove
for receiving the point of
the set screw is this: The
point of the set screw indents
the nut and raises a
bur which would interfere
with the free turning of
the nut in the recess if
the bur was not at the
bottom of a groove. Additional
security is obtained
by drilling a hole
through the point of the bolt, and fitting it with a split pin E.</p>

<p>Locking arrangements for nuts are exceedingly numerous,
and many of them are very ingenious, but want of space prevents
us describing them. We may point out, however, that
many very good locking arrangements have the defect of only
locking the nut at certain points of a revolution, say at every
30&deg;. It will be noticed that the two arrangements which we
have described are not open to this objection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV. &nbsp; KEYS.</h2>


<p><i>Keys</i> are wedges, generally rectangular in section, but sometimes
circular; they are made of wrought iron or steel, and
are used for securing wheels, pulleys, cranks, &amp;c., to shafts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/illus030.jpg" width="640" height="398" alt="Fig. 20." title="Fig. 20." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 20.</span>
</div>

<p>Various sections of keys are shown in fig. 20. At (<i>a</i>) is the
<i>hollow</i> or <i>saddle key</i>. With this form of key it is not necessary
to cut the shaft in any way, but its holding power is small, and
it is therefore only used for light work. At (<i>b</i>) is the <i>key on a
flat</i>, sometimes called a <i>flat key</i>. The holding power of this
key is much greater than that of the saddle key. At (<i>c</i>) is
the <i>sunk key</i>, a very secure and very common form.</p>

<p>The part of the shaft upon which a key rests is called the
<i>key bed</i> or <i>key way</i>, and the recess in the boss of the wheel or
pulley into which the key fits is called the <i>key way</i>; both are
also called <i>key seats</i>. With saddle, flat, and sunk keys the key
bed is parallel to the axis of the shaft; but the key way is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
deeper at one end than the other to accommodate the taper of
the key. The sides of the key are parallel.</p>

<p>The <i>round key</i> or taper pin shown at (<i>d</i>) is in general only
used for wheels or cranks which have been previously shrunk
on to their shafts or forced on by great pressure. After the
wheel or crank has been shrunk on, a hole is drilled, half into
the shaft and half into the wheel or crank, to receive the
pin.</p>

<p>When the point of a key is inaccessible the other end is
provided with a <i>gib head</i> as shown at (<i>e</i>), to enable the key to
be withdrawn.</p>

<p>A <i>sliding</i> or <i>feather key</i> secures a piece to a shaft so far as
to prevent the one from rotating without the other, but allows
of relative motion in the direction of the axis of the shaft.
This form of key has no taper, and it is secured to the piece
carried by the shaft, but is made a <i>sliding fit</i> in the key way of
the shaft. In one form of feather key the part within the
piece carried by the shaft is dovetailed as shown at (<i>f</i>). In
another form the key has a round projecting pin forged upon
it, which enters a corresponding hole as shown at (<i>g</i>). The
feather key may also be secured to the piece carried by the
shaft by means of one or more screws as shown at (<i>h</i>). The
key way in the shaft is made long enough to permit of the
necessary sliding motion.</p>

<p><i>Cone Keys.</i>&mdash;These are sometimes fitted to pulleys, and are
shown in fig. 32, page 38. In this case the eye of the pulley
is tapered and is larger than the shaft. The space between
the shaft and the boss of the pulley is filled with three <i>saddle</i> or
<i>cone keys</i>. These keys are made of cast iron and are all cast
together, and before being divided the casting is bored to fit
the shaft and turned to fit the eye of the pulley. By this
arrangement of keys the same pulley may be fixed on shafts of
different diameters by using keys of different thicknesses; also
the pulley may be bored out large enough to pass over any
boss which may be forged on the shaft.</p>

<h2>V. &nbsp; SHAFTING.</h2>


<p>Shafting is nearly always cylindrical and made of wrought
iron or steel. Cast iron is rarely used for shafting.</p>

<p><i>Axles</i> are shafts which are subjected to bending without
twisting.</p>

<p>The parts of a shaft or axle which rest upon the bearings
or supports are called <i>journals</i>, <i>pivots</i>, or <i>collars</i>.</p>

<p>In journals the supporting pressure is at right angles to the
axis of the shaft, while in pivots and collars the pressure is
parallel to that axis.</p>

<p>Shafts may be solid or hollow. Hollow shafts are stronger
than solid shafts for the same weight of material. Thus a
hollow shaft having an external diameter of 10&frac14; inches and an
internal diameter of 7 inches would have about the same weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
as a solid shaft of the same material 7&frac12; inches in diameter, but
the former would have about double the strength of the latter.
Hollow shafts are also stiffer and yield less to bending action
than solid shafts, which in some cases, as in propeller shafts,
is an objection.</p>



<hr style="width: 15%;" />
<h2>VI. &nbsp; SHAFT COUPLINGS.</h2>


<p>For convenience of making and handling, shafts used for
transmitting power are generally made in lengths not exceeding
30 feet. These lengths are connected by couplings, of which
we give several examples.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 706px;">
<img src="images/illus033.jpg" width="706" height="600" alt="Figs. 21, 22." title="Figs. 21, 22." />
<span class="caption">Figs. 21 and 22.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Solid</i>, <i>Box</i>, or <i>Muff Couplings.</i>&mdash;One form of box coupling is
shown in fig. 21. Here the ends of the shafts to be connected
butt against one another, meeting at the centre of the box,
which is made of cast iron. The shafts are made to rotate as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
one by being secured to the box by two wrought-iron or steel
keys, both driven from the same end of the box. A clearance
space is left between the head of the forward key and the
point of the hind one, to facilitate the driving of them out, as
then only one key needs to be started at a time. Sometimes
a single key the whole length of the box is used, in which case
it is necessary that the key ways in the shafts be of exactly
the same depth.</p>

<p>The half-lap coupling, introduced by Sir William Fairbairn,
is shown in fig. 22. In this form of box coupling the ends of
the shafts overlap within the box. It is evident that one shaft
cannot rotate without the other as long as the box remains over
the lap. To keep the box in its place it is fitted with a saddle
key.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the lap joint is sloped in such a
way as to prevent the two lengths of shaft from being
pulled asunder by forces acting in the direction of their length.</p>

<p>Half-lap couplings are not used for shafts above 5 inches
in diameter.</p>

<p>It may here be pointed out that the half-lap coupling is
expensive to make, and is now not much used.</p>

<p>As shafts are weakened by cutting key ways in them, very
often the ends which carry couplings are enlarged in diameter,
as shown in fig. 21, by an amount equal to the thickness of the
key. An objection to this enlargement is that wheels and
pulleys require either that their bosses be bored out large
enough to pass over it, or that they be split into halves, which
are bolted together after being placed on the shaft.</p>

flanges butt against one
another, and are connected

be parallel or tapered;
generally they are tapered.
A parallel bolt must have
a head, but a tapered bolt
will act without one. In
fig. 23 the bolts are tapered,
and also provided with
heads. In fig. 14, page 17,
is shown a tapered bolt without a head. The variation of

</div>

<p>An example of a very simple form of bearing is shown in
fig. 25, which represents a brake shaft carrier of a locomotive
tender. The bearing in this example is made of cast iron and
in one piece. Through the oval-shaped flange two bolts pass
for attaching the bearing to the wrought-iron framing of the
tender. With this form of bearing there is no adjustment for
wear, so that when it becomes worn it must be renewed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span> 25: <i>Brake Shaft Carrier.</i>&mdash;Draw the elevation and
sectional plan of the bearing shown in fig. 25. Draw also a vertical
section through the axis. The latter view to be projected from
the first elevation. Scale 6 inches to a foot.</p></div>


<p><i>Pillow Block</i>, <i>Plummer Block</i>, or <i>Pedestal</i>.&mdash;The ordinary
form of plummer block is represented in fig. 26. A is the
block proper, B the
sole through which
pass the holding-down
bolts. C is the cap.
Between the block
and the cap is the
brass bush, which is in
halves, called <i>brasses</i>
or <i>steps</i>. The bed for
the steps in this example
is cylindrical,
and is prepared by the
easy process of boring.
The steps are not
supported throughout
their whole length,
but at their ends only where fitting strips are provided as
shown. As the wear on a step is generally greatest at the
bottom, it is made thicker there than at the sides, except
where the fitting strips come in. To prevent the steps turning
within the block they are generally furnished with lugs, which
enter corresponding recesses in the block and cover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>In the block illustrated the journal is lubricated by a <i>needle
lubricator</i>; this consists of an inverted glass bottle fitted with
a wood stopper, through a hole in which passes a piece of wire,
which has one end in the oil within the bottle, and the other
resting on the journal of the shaft. The wire or needle does
not fill the hole in the stopper, but if the needle is kept from
vibrating the oil does not escape owing to capillary attraction.
When, however, the shaft rotates, the needle begins to vibrate,
and the oil runs down slowly on to the journal; oil is therefore
only used when the shaft is running.</p>

<p><i>Proportions of Pillow Blocks.</i>&mdash;The following rules may
be used for proportioning pillow blocks for shafts up to 8 inches
diameter. It should be remembered that the proportions used
by different makers vary considerably, but the following rules

<p>The length of the journal varies very much in different
cases, and depends upon the speed of the shaft, the load which
it carries, the workmanship of the journal and bearing, and the
method of lubrication. For ordinary shafting one rule is to
make <i>l</i> = <i>d</i> + 1. Some makers use the rule <i>l</i> = 1&middot;5<i>d</i>; others
make <i>l</i> = 2<i>d</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<h2>VIII. &nbsp;  PULLEYS.</h2>


<p><i>Velocity Ratio in Belt Gearing.</i>&mdash;Let two pulleys A and B
be connected by a belt, and let their diameters be D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>;
and let their speeds, in revolutions per minute, be N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>
respectively. If there is no slipping, the speeds of the rims of
the pulleys will be the same as that of the belt, and will therefore
be equal. Now the speed of the rim of A is evidently
= D<sub>1</sub> &times; 3&middot;1416 &times; N<sub>1</sub>; while the speed of the rim of B is =
D<sub>2</sub> &times; 3&middot;1416 &times; N<sub>2</sub>. Hence D<sub>1</sub> &times; 3&middot;1416 &times; N<sub>1</sub> = D<sub>2</sub> &times; 3&middot;1416 &times; N<sub>2</sub>,
and therefore</p>

</table></div>

<p><i>Pulleys for Flat Bands.</i>&mdash;In cross section the rim of a
pulley for carrying a flat band is generally curved as shown
in figs. 31 and 32, but very often the cross section is straight.
The curved cross section of the rim tends to keep the band
from coming off as long as the pulley is rotating. Sometimes
the rim of the pulley is provided with flanges which keep the
band from falling off.</p>

<p>Pulleys are generally made entirely of cast iron, but a great
many pulleys are now made in which the centre or nave only
is of cast iron, the arms being of wrought iron cast into the
nave, while the rim is of wrought sheet iron.</p>

<p>The arms of pulleys when made of wrought iron are
invariably straight, but when made of cast iron they are very
often curved. In fig. 31, which shows an arrangement of two
cast-iron pulleys, the arms are straight; while in fig. 32, which
shows another cast-iron pulley, the arms are curved. Through
unequal cooling, and therefore unequal contraction of a cast-iron,
pulley in the mould, the arms are generally in a state of
tension or compression; and if the arms are straight they are
very unyielding, so that the result of this initial stress is often
the breaking of an arm, or of the rim where it joins an arm.
With the curved arm, however, its shape permits it to yield,
and thus cause a diminution of the stress due to unequal contraction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The cross section of the arms of cast-iron pulleys is generally
elliptical.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise 31:</span> <i>Fast and Loose Pulleys</i>.&mdash;Fig. 31 shows an
arrangement of fast and loose pulleys. A is the fast pulley, secured
to the shaft C by a sunk key; B is the loose pulley, which turns
freely upon the shaft. The loose pulley is prevented from coming off
by a collar D, which is secured to the shaft by a tapered pin as
shown. The nave or boss of the loose pulley is here fitted with a
brass liner, which may be renewed when it becomes too much worn.
Draw the elevations shown, completing the left-hand one. Scale 6
inches to a foot.</p>

<p>By the above arrangement of pulleys a machine may be stopped
or set in motion at pleasure. When the driving band is on the
loose pulley the machine is at rest, and when it is on the fast
pulley the machine is in motion. The driving band is shifted from
the one pulley to the other by pressing on that side of the band
which is advancing towards the pulleys.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise 32</span>: <i>Cast-iron Pulley with Curved Arms and Cone
Keys</i>.&mdash;Draw a complete side elevation and a complete cross section
of the pulley represented in fig. 32 to a scale of 3 inches to a foot.
In drawing the side elevation of the arms first draw the centre lines
as shown; next draw three circles for each arm, one at each end
and one in the middle; the centres of these circles being on the
centre line of the arm, and their diameters equal to the widths of the
arm at the ends and at the middle respectively. Arcs of circles are
then drawn to touch these three circles. The centres and radii of
these arcs may be found by trial. The cone keys for securing the
pulley to the shaft were described on p. 23.</p></div>

<p><i>Pulleys for Ropes</i>.&mdash;Ropes made of hemp are now extensively
used for transmitting power. These ropes vary in
diameter from 1 inch to 2 inches, and are run at a speed of
about 4,500 feet per minute. The pulleys for these ropes are
made of cast iron, and have their rims grooved as shown in
fig. 33, which is a cross section of the rim of a pulley carrying
three ropes. The angle of the V is usually 45&deg;, and the rope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
rests on the sides of the groove, and not on the bottom, so that
it is wedged in, and has therefore a good hold of the pulley.
The diameter of the pulley should not be less than 30 times
the diameter of the rope. Two pulleys connected by ropes
should not be less than thirty feet apart from centre to centre,
but this distance may be as much as 100 feet.</p>

<h2>IX. &nbsp;  TOOTHED WHEELS.</h2>


<p><i>Pitch Surfaces of Spur Wheels.</i>&mdash;Let two smooth rollers be
placed in contact with their axes parallel, and let one of them
rotate about its axis; then if there is no slipping the other
roller will rotate in the opposite direction with the same
surface velocity; and if D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> be the diameters of the rollers,
and N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> their speeds in revolutions per minute, it follows as
in belt gearing that&mdash;</p>

<p>If there be considerable resistance to the motion of the
follower slipping may take place, and it may stop. To prevent
this the rollers may be provided with teeth; then they become
<i>spur wheels</i>; and if the teeth be so shaped that the ratio of
the speeds of the toothed rollers at any instant is the same as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
that of the smooth rollers, the surfaces of the latter are called
the <i>pitch surfaces</i> of the former.</p>

<p><i>Pitch Circle.</i>&mdash;A section of the pitch surface of a toothed
wheel by a plane perpendicular to its axis is a circle, and is
called a <i>pitch circle</i>. We may also say that the pitch circle is
the edge of the pitch surface. The pitch circle is generally
traced on the side of a toothed wheel, and is rather nearer the
points of the teeth than the roots.</p>

<p><i>Pitch of Teeth.</i>&mdash;The distance from the centre of one tooth
to the centre of the next, or from the front of one to the front
of the next, <i>measured at the pitch circle</i>, is called the <i>pitch of
the teeth</i>. If D be the diameter of the pitch circle of a wheel,
<i>n</i> the number of teeth, and <i>p</i> the pitch of the teeth, then
D &times; 3&middot;1416 = <i>n</i> &times; <i>p</i>.</p>

wheel teeth is shown in fig. 34. The curves of the teeth should
be cycloidal curves, although they are generally drawn in as
arcs of circles. It does not fall within the scope of this work
to discuss the correct forms of wheel teeth. The student will

<h2>X. &nbsp; CRANKS AND CRANKED SHAFTS.</h2>


<p>The most important application of the crank is in the
steam-engine, where the reciprocating rectilineal motion of
the piston is converted into the rotary motion of the crank-shaft
by means of the crank and connecting rod.</p>

<p>At one time steam-engine cranks were largely made of
cast iron, now they are always made of wrought iron or steel.
The crank is either forged in one piece with the shaft, or it is
made separately and then keyed to it.</p>

<p><i>Overhung Crank.</i>&mdash;Fig. 37 shows a wrought-iron overhung
crank. A is the crank-shaft, B the crank arm, provided at
one end with a boss C, which is bored out to fit the shaft; at
the other end of the crank arm is a boss D, which is bored out
to receive the crank-pin E, which works in one end of the
connecting rod. The crank is secured to the shaft by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
sunk key F. It is also good practice to <i>shrink</i> the crank on
to the shaft. The process of shrinking consists of boring out
the crank a little smaller than the shaft, and then heating it,
which causes it to expand sufficiently to go on to the shaft.
As the crank cools, it shrinks and grips the shaft firmly. The
crank may also be shrunk on to the crank-pin, the latter being
then riveted over as shown in fig. 37.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 781px;">
<img src="images/illus052.png" width="781" height="600" alt="Fig. 37." title="Fig. 37." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 37.</span>
</div>

<p>A good plan to adopt in preference to the shrinking process
is to force the parts together by hydraulic pressure. This
method is adopted for placing locomotive wheels on their axles,
and for putting in crank-pins. As to the amount of pressure
to be used, the practice is to allow a force of 10 tons for every
inch of diameter of the pin, axle, or shaft.</p>

<p>Instead of being riveted in, the crank pin may be prolonged
and screwed, and fitted with a nut. Another plan is to put a
cotter through the crank and the crank-pin.</p>

<p>The distance from the centre of the crank-shaft to the
centre of the crank-pin is called the radius of the crank. The
<i>throw</i> of the crank is twice the radius. In a direct-acting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
engine the throw of the crank is equal to the stroke of the
piston.</p>

the crank-pin, and D and E the crank arms. Only one half of
the axle is shown in fig. 38, but the other half is exactly the
same. The cranks on the two halves are, however, at right
angles to one another. The ends of the crank arms are turned
in the lathe, the crank-pin ends being turned at the same time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

very unreliable, the built-up crank shown in fig. 39 being
preferred, although it is much heavier than the other. It will
be seen from the figure that the shaft, crank arms, and crank-pin
are made separately. The arms are shrunk on to the pin
and the shaft, and secured to the latter by sunk keys. These
heavy shafts and cranks are generally made of steel.</p>

<h2>XI. &nbsp; ECCENTRICS.</h2>


<p>The <i>eccentric</i> is a particular form of crank, being a crank in
which the crank-pin is large enough to embrace the crank-shaft.
In the eccentric what corresponds to the crank-pin is called
the sheave or pulley. The advantage which an eccentric
possesses over a crank is that the shaft does not require to be
divided at the point where the eccentric is put on. The crank,
however, has this advantage over the eccentric, namely, that it
can be used for converting circular into reciprocating motion,
or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, while the eccentric can only be used for converting
circular into reciprocating motion. This is owing to
the great leverage at which the friction of the eccentric
acts.</p>

<p>The chief application of the eccentric is in the steam-engine,
where it is used for working the valve gear.</p>

<p>To permit of the sheave being placed on the shaft without
going over the end (which could not be done at all in the case of
a cranked axle, and would be a troublesome operation in most
cases) it is generally made in two pieces, as shown in fig. 40,
which represents one of the eccentrics of a locomotive. The
two parts of the sheave are connected by two cotter bolts. The
part which embraces the sheave is called the eccentric strap,
and corresponds to, and is, in fact, a connecting rod end: the
rod proceeding from this is called the eccentric rod.</p>

<p>The distance from the centre of the sheave to the centre of
the shaft is called the <i>radius</i> or <i>eccentricity</i> of the eccentric.
The <i>throw</i> is twice the eccentricity.</p>

<p>The sheave is generally made of cast iron. The strap may
be of brass, cast iron, or wrought iron; when the strap is made
of wrought iron it is commonly lined with brass.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span> 40: <i>Locomotive Eccentric.</i>&mdash;In fig. 40 D E is the

<h2>XII. &nbsp; CONNECTING RODS.</h2>


<p>The most familiar example of the use of a connecting rod
is in the steam-engine, where it is used to connect the rotating
crank with the reciprocating piston. The rod itself is made of
wrought iron or steel, and is generally circular or rectangular in
section. The ends of the rod are fitted with steps, which are
held together in a variety of ways.</p>

<p><i>Strap End.</i>&mdash;A form of connecting rod end, which is not
so common as it used to be, is shown in fig. 41. At (<i>a</i>) is
shown a longitudinal section with all the parts put together,
while at (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), <i>(d)</i> and (<i>e</i>) the details are shown separately.
A B is the end of the rod which butts against the brass bush
C D, which is in two pieces. A <i>strap</i> E passes round the bush
and on to the end of the rod as shown. The arms of the strap
have rectangular holes in them, which are not quite opposite
a similar hole in the rod when the parts are put together. If
a wedge or <i>cotter</i> F be driven into these three holes they will
tend to come into line, and the parts of the bush will be pressed
together. To prevent the cotter opening out the strap, and to
increase the sliding surface, a <i>gib</i> H is introduced. The gib is
provided with horns at its ends to keep it in its place. Sometimes
two gibs are used, one on each side of the cotter; this
makes the sliding surface on both sides of the cotter the same.
The cotter is secured by a set screw K. The unsectioned
portion of fig. (<i>a</i>) to the right of the gib, or to the left of the
cotter, is called the <i>clearance</i> or <i>draught.</i></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span> 41: <i>Connecting Rod End.</i>&mdash;Make the following views
of the connecting rod end illustrated by fig. 41. First, a vertical
section, the same as shown at (<i>a</i>). Second, a horizontal section.
Third, side elevation. Fourth, a plan. Or the first and third views
may be combined in a half vertical section and half elevation; and
the second and fourth views may be combined in a half horizontal
section and half plan.</p>

<p>All the dimensions are to be taken from the detail drawings (<i>b</i>),
(<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>), and (<i>e</i>), <i>but the details need not be drawn separately</i>. The
brass bush is shown at (<i>d</i>) by half elevation, half vertical section,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>half plan, and half horizontal section. The draught or clearance is
7-16ths of an inch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Box End.</i>&mdash;At (<i>a</i>), fig. 42, is shown what is known as a box
end for a connecting rod. The part which corresponds to the
loose strap in the last example is here forged in one piece with
the connecting rod. In this form the brass bush is provided
with a flange all round on one side, but on the opposite side
the flange is omitted except at one end; this is to allow of the
bush being placed within the end of the rod. The construction
of the bush will be understood by reference to the sketch shown
at (<i>b</i>). The bush is in two parts, which are pressed tightly together
by means of a cotter. This cotter is prevented from
slackening back by two set screws. Each set screw is cut off
square at the point, and presses on the flat bottom of a very
shallow groove cut on the side of the cotter.</p>

<p>The top, bottom, and ends of this box end are turned in
the lathe at the same time as the rod itself; this accounts for
the curved sections of these parts.</p>

<p>It is clear from the construction of a box end that it is
only suitable for an overhung crank.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise 42:</span> <i>Locomotive Connecting Rod.</i>&mdash;In fig. 42 is shown
a connecting rod for an outside cylinder locomotive. (<i>a</i>) is the
crank-pin end, and (<i>c</i>) the cross-head end. The end (<i>a</i>) has just
been described under the head 'box end.' We may just add that
in this particular example the brass bush is lined with white metal
as shown, and that the construction of the oil-box is the same as
that on the coupling rod end shown in fig. 44. The end (<i>c</i>) is
forked, and through the prongs of the fork passes the cross-head pin,
of which a separate dimensioned drawing is shown at (<i>d</i>). Observe
that the tapered parts A and B of this pin are parts of the same
cone. The rotation of the pin is prevented by a small key as shown.
The cross-head pin need not be drawn separately, and the isometric
projection of the bush at (<i>b</i>) may be omitted, but all the other
views shown are to be drawn to a scale of 6 inches to a foot.</p></div>

<p><i>Marine Connecting Rod.</i>&mdash;The form of connecting rod
shown in fig. 43 is that used in marine engines, but it is also
used extensively in land engines. A B is the crank-pin end,
and C the cross-head end. The end A B is forged in one piece,
and after it is turned, planed, and bored it is slotted across, so
as to cut off the cap A. The parts A and B are held together
by two bolts as shown. This end of the rod is fitted with
brass steps, which are lined with white metal. The cross-head
end is forked, and through the prongs of the fork passes a pin
D, which also passes through the cross-head, which is forged on
to the piston rod or attached to it in some other way.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise 43:</span> <i>Marine Connecting Rod.</i>&mdash;Draw all the views
shown in fig. 43 of one form of marine connecting rod. For detail
drawings of the locking arrangement for the nuts see fig. 19, page
21. Scale 4 inches to a foot.</p></div>

<p><i>Coupling Rods.</i>&mdash;A rod used to transmit the motion of one
crank to another is called a <i>coupling rod</i>. A familiar example
of the use of coupling rods will be found in the locomotive.
Coupling rods are made of wrought iron or steel, and are
generally of rectangular section. The ends are now generally
made solid and lined with solid brass bushes, <i>without any
adjustment for wear</i>. This form of coupling rod end is found
to answer very well in locomotive practice where the workmanship
and arrangements for lubrication are excellent.
When the brass bush becomes worn it is replaced by a new
one.</p>

<p>Fig. 44 shows an example of a locomotive coupling rod end
for an outside cylinder engine. In this case it is desirable to
have the crank-pin bearings for the coupling rods as short as
possible, for a connecting rod and coupling rod in this kind of
engine work side by side on the same crank-pin, which, being
overhung, should be as short as convenient for the sake of
strength. The requisite bearing surface is obtained by having
a pin of large diameter. The brass bush is prevented from
rotating by means of the square key shown. The oil-box is
cut out of the solid, and has a wrought-iron cover slightly
dovetailed at the edges. This cover fits into a check round
the top inner edge of the box, which is originally parallel, but
is made to close on the dovetailed edges of the cover by riveting.
A hole in the centre of this cover, which gives access to
the oil-box, is fitted with a screwed brass plug. The brass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
plug has a screwed hole in the centre, through which oil may
be introduced to the box. Dust is kept out of the oil-box by
screwing into the hole in the brass plug a common cork. The
oil is carried slowly but regularly from the oil-box over to the
bearing by a piece of cotton wick.</p>

<p>An example of a steam-engine cross-head is shown in

the cross-head B. The cross-head pin shown at (<i>d</i>), fig. 42, and
to which the connecting rod is attached, works in the bearing
C. Projecting pieces D, forged on the top and bottom of the

<h2>XIV. &nbsp; PISTONS.</h2>


<p>A <i>piston</i> is generally a cylindrical piece which slides backwards
and forwards inside a hollow cylinder. The piston may
be moved by the action of fluid pressure upon it as in a
steam-engine, or it may be used to give motion to a fluid as in
a pump.</p>

<p>A piston is usually attached to a rod, called a <i>piston rod</i>,
which passes through the end of the cylinder inside which the
piston works, and which serves to transmit the motion of the
piston to some piece outside the cylinder, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 629px;">
<img src="images/illus065.png" width="629" height="600" alt="Fig. 46." title="Fig. 46." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 46.</span>
</div>

<p>A <i>plunger</i> is a piston made in one piece with its piston rod,
the piston and the rod being of the same diameter.</p>

<p>A piston which is provided with one or more valves which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
allow the fluid to pass through it from one side to the other is
called a <i>bucket</i>.</p>

<p><i>Simple Piston.</i>&mdash;The simplest form of piston is a plain
cylinder fitting accurately another, inside which it moves.
Such a piston works with very little friction, but as there is
no adjustment for wear, such a piston is not suitable for a high
fluid pressure if it has to work constantly. This simple form of
piston is used in the steam-engine indicator, and also in
pumps.</p>

<p>Fig. 46 shows the piston of the circulation pump of a marine
engine. A is the cast-iron casing or barrel of the pump; B is
a brass liner fitting tightly into the former at its ends, and
secured by eight screwed Muntz metal pins C, four at each end;
D is the piston, which is made of brass, and is attached to
a Muntz metal piston rod E. The liner is bored out smooth
and true from end to end, and the piston is turned so as to be
a sliding fit to the liner. The wear in this form of piston is

<p><i>Pump Bucket.</i>&mdash;The next form of piston which we illustrate

with six india-rubber disc valves. The rod is in this case
made of Muntz metal. Air-pump rods for marine engines are
very often made of wrought iron cased with brass. It will be
observed that there is a wide groove around the bucket, which
is filled with hempen rope or gasket. This gasket forms an
elastic packing which prevents leakage. This is an old-fashioned
form of packing, and is now only used for pump
buckets.</p>

<p><i>Ramsbottom's Packing.</i>&mdash;The form of packing used in the
air-pump bucket, fig. 47, is not suitable for steam pistons.
For the latter the packing is now always metallic. The
simplest form of metallic packing is that known as Ramsbottom's.
This form is very largely used for locomotive pistons,
and for small pistons in many kinds of engines besides. A
locomotive piston for an 18-inch cylinder with Ramsbottom's
packing is shown in fig. 48. The
particular piston there illustrated
is made of brass, and is secured
to a wrought-iron piston rod by
a brass nut. Two circumferential
grooves of rectangular section are
turned out of the piston, and into
these fit two corresponding rings,
which may be of brass, cast iron,
or steel. In this example the
rings are of cast iron. These rings
are first turned a little larger
in diameter than the bore of the
cylinder (in this example <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch),
and then sprung over the piston
into the groves prepared for them.
Their own elasticity causes the
rings to press outwards on the
cylinder. At the point where a
ring is split a leakage of steam
will take place, but with quick-running
pistons this leakage is unimportant.
The points where the
rings are cut should be placed diametrically opposite, so as to
diminish the leakage of steam.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise 48:</span> <i>Locomotive Piston.</i>&mdash;A part elevation and part
section of a locomotive piston, for a cylinder having a bore 18 inches
in diameter, is shown in fig. 48. Draw this, and also a view looking
on the nut in the direction of the axis of the piston rod. Scale 6
inches to a foot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The reason why the part of the piston rod within the
piston has such a quick taper is that the piston has to be taken off
the rod while it is in the cylinder. The cross-head being forged on
the end of the piston rod prevents the piston and piston rod being
withdrawn together.</p></div>

<p><i>Large Pistons.</i>&mdash;Pistons of large diameter are generally
provided with two cast-iron packing rings placed within the
same groove. These rings are pressed outwards against the
cylinder, and also against the sides of the groove by one or
more springs. One form of this packing (Lancaster's) is shown
in fig. 49. Here one spring only is used, and it is first made
a straight spiral spring, and then bent round and its ends united.
The action of the spring will be clearly understood from the
illustration. For the purpose of admitting the packing rings
the piston is divided into two parts, one the piston proper,
and the other the <i>junk ring</i>. In fig. 49, A is the junk ring,
which is secured to the piston by means of bolts as shown.</p>

fig. 49 is for the high-pressure cylinder of a marine engine. The

nuts for the latter are of brass. The spiral spring is made from

<h2>XV. &nbsp;  STUFFING-BOXES.</h2>

</div>


<p>In fig. 50 is shown a gland and stuffing-box for the piston
rod of a vertical engine. A B is the piston rod, C D a portion
of the cylinder cover, and E F the <i>stuffing-box</i>. Fitting into
the bottom of the stuffing-box is a brass bush H. The space
K around the rod A B is filled with <i>packing</i>, of which there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a variety of kinds, the simplest being greased hempen rope.
The packing is compressed by screwing down the cast-iron
gland L M, which is lined with a brass bush N. In this case
the gland is screwed down by means of three stud-bolts P,
which are screwed into a flange cast on the stuffing-box.
Surrounding the rod on the top of the gland there is a recess
R for holding the lubricant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 768px;">

</div>

<p>The object of the gland and stuffing-box is to allow the
piston rod to move backwards and forwards freely without any
leakage of steam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 51 shows a gland and stuffing-box for a horizontal rod.
The essential difference between this example and the last is
in the mode of lubrication. The gland flange has cast within
it an oil-box which is covered by a lid; this lid is kept shut
or open by the action of a small spring as shown. A piece of
cotton wick (not shown in the figure) has one end trailing in the
oil in the oil-box, while the other is carried over and passed
down the hole A B. The wick acts as a siphon, and drops the
oil gradually on to the rod. In this example only two bolts
are used for screwing in the gland; and the flanges of the gland
and stuffing-box are not circular, but oval-shaped.</p>

<p>In the case of small rods the gland is made entirely of
brass, and no liner is then necessary. Fig. 52 shows a form
of gland and stuffing-box sometimes used for small rods. The
stuffing-box is screwed externally, and carries a nut A B which
moves the gland.</p>

<p>A more elaborate form of gland and stuffing-box is shown
in fig. 53. This is for a large marine engine with inverted
cylinders, such as is used on board large ocean steamers. The
stuffing-box is cast separate from the cylinder cover to which
it is afterwards bolted. The lubricant is first introduced to
the oil-boxes marked A, from which it passes to the recess B,
where it comes in contact with the piston rod. To prevent
the lubricant from being wasted by running down the rod, the
main gland is provided with a shallow gland and stuffing-box
which is filled with soft cotton packing, which soaks up the
lubricant.</p>

<p>The main gland is screwed up by means of six bolts, and
to prevent the gland from locking itself in the stuffing-box, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
is necessary that the nuts should be turned together. This is
done in a simple and ingenious manner. One-half of each
nut is provided with teeth, and these gear with a toothed
wheel which has a rim only; this rim is held up by a ring C.
When one nut is turned, all the rest follow in the same direction.</p>

<h2>XVI. &nbsp;  VALVES.</h2>


<p>Professor Unwin divides valves, according to their construction
into three classes as follows:&mdash;(1) flap valves, which
bond or turn upon a hinge; (2) lift valves, which rise perpendicularly
to the seat; (3) sliding valves, which move parallel
to the seat.</p>

<p>Examples of flap valves are shown in figs. 54 and 55; two
forms of lift valves are shown in figs. 56 and 57, and in figs.
58 and 59 are shown two forms of slide valve. The slide valve
shown in fig. 58 moves in a straight line, while that shown in
fig. 59 (called a cock) moves in circle.</p>

<p><i>India-rubber Valves.</i>&mdash;In india-rubber valves there is a
grating covered by a piece of india-rubber, which may be rectangular,
but is generally circular, and which is held down
along one edge if rectangular, or at the centre if circular.
Water or other fluid can pass freely upwards through the
grating, but when it attempts to return the elasticity of the
india-rubber, and the pressure of the water upon it, cause it to lie
close on the grating, and thus prevent the return of the water.
The india-rubber is prevented from rising too high by a perforated
guard. In fig. 54 is shown an example of an india-rubber
disc valve. A is the grating, B the india-rubber, C the
guard secured to the grating or seat by the stud D and nut
E. The grating is held in position by bolts and nuts F. The
grating and guard are generally of brass.</p>

<p>India-rubber disc valves are also shown on the air-pump
bucket, fig. 47.</p>

<p><i>Kinghorn's Metallic Valve.</i>&mdash;The action of this valve is the
same as that of an india-rubber valve, but a thin sheet of
metal (phosphor bronze) takes the place of the india-rubber.</p>

<p>This valve is now largely used in the pumps of marine
engines, and is shown in fig. 55 as applied to an air-pump
bucket. Three valves like the one shown are arranged round
the bucket.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span> 57: <i>Kinghorn's Metallic Valve.</i>&mdash;Fig. 55 shows an

<p><i>Conical Disc Valves.</i>&mdash;A very common form of valve is
that shown in figs. 56 and 57. This form of valve consists of
a disc, the edge of which (called the face) is conical. The
conical edge of this disc fits accurately on a corresponding
seat. The angle which the valve face makes with its axis is
generally 45&deg;. If the disc is raised, either by the action of
the fluid as in the india-rubber valve, or by other means, an
opening is formed around the disc through which the fluid
can pass. The valve is guided in rising and falling either by
three feathers underneath it, as in fig. 56, or by a central
spindle which moves freely through a hole in the centre of a
bridge which stretches across the seat, as in fig. 57. The lift of
the valve is limited by a stop above it, which forms part of the
casing containing the valve. The lift should in no case exceed
one-fourth of the diameter of the valve, and it is generally
much less than this. The guiding feathers (fig. 56) are notched
immediately under the disc for the purpose of making available
the full circumferential opening of the valve for the passage
of the fluid. These notches also prevent the feathers from
interfering with the turning or scraping of the valve face.</p>

<p>Conical disc valves and their seats are nearly always made
of brass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Simple Slide Valve.</i>&mdash;The form of valve shown in fig. 58,
often called the <i>locomotive slide valve</i>, is very largely used in all
classes of steam-engines for distributing the steam in the
steam cylinders. The valve is shown separately at (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>),
and (<i>f</i>), while at (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>) is shown its connection with
the steam cylinder.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the valve itself is in the shape of
a box with one side open, the edges of the open side being
flanged. When the valve is in its middle position, as shown
at (<i>a</i>), two of these flanged edges completely cover two rectangular
openings S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, called <i>steam ports</i>, while the hollow
part of the valve is opposite to a third port E, called the <i>exhaust
port</i>. As shown at (<i>a</i>) the piston P would be moving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
upwards and the valve downwards. By the time the piston
has reached the top of its stroke the valve will have moved
so far down as to partly uncover the steam port S<sub>1</sub>, and admit
steam from the valve casing C through S<sub>1</sub> and the passage P<sub>1</sub>
to the top of the piston. The pressure of this steam on the
top of the piston will force the latter down. While the above
action has been going on, the port S<sub>2</sub> will have become uncovered,
and the hollow part of the valve will be opposite both
the steam port S<sub>2</sub> and the exhaust port E, so that the steam
from the under side of the piston, and which forced the piston
up, can now escape by the passage P<sub>2</sub>, the steam port S<sub>2</sub>, and
the exhaust port E to the exhaust outlet O, and thence into
the atmosphere, if it is a non-condensing engine, or into the
condenser if it is a condensing engine, or into another cylinder
if it is a compound engine. After the piston has performed,
a certain part of its downward stroke, the valve, which has
been moving downwards, will commence to move upwards,
and when it has reached a certain point it will cover the port
S<sub>1</sub>, and shut off the supply of steam to the top of the piston.
It is generally arranged that the steam shall be cut off before
the piston reaches the end of the stroke. When the piston
reaches the bottom of its stroke the valve has moved far
enough up to uncover the port S<sub>2</sub> and admit steam to the
bottom of the piston, and to uncover the port S<sub>1</sub> and allow
the steam to escape from the top of the piston through the
passage P<sub>1</sub>, the port S<sub>1</sub>, the port E, and outlet O. In this
way the piston is moved up and down in the cylinder.</p>

<p>The valve is attached to a valve spindle S by nuts as
shown, the hole in the valve through which the spindle passes
being oval-shaped to permit of the valve adjusting itself so as
to always press on its seat.</p>

<p>When the valve is in its middle position it generally more
than covers the steam ports. The amount which the valve
projects over the steam port on the outside, the valve being
in its middle position, is called the <i>outside lap</i> of the valve,
and the amount which it projects on the inside is called the
<i>inside lap</i>. When the term lap is used without any qualification,
outside lap is to be understood. In fig. 58 it will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
seen that the valve has no inside lap, and that the outside lap
is three-eighths of an inch. The inside lap is generally small
compared with the outside lap.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>When the piston is at the beginning of its stroke the steam
port is generally open by a small amount called the <i>lead</i> of the
valve.</p>

<p>The reciprocating motion of the slide valve is nearly always
derived from an eccentric fixed on the crank-shaft of the
engine. Slide valves are generally made of brass, bronze, or
cast iron.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span> 59: <i>Simple Slide Valve.</i>&mdash;At (<i>d</i>), fig. 58, is shown a
sectional elevation of a simple slide valve for a steam-engine, the
section being taken through the centre line of the valve spindle,
while at (<i>e</i>) is shown a cross section and elevation, and at (<i>f</i>) a plan
of the same. Draw all these views full size, and also a sectional
elevation at A B. The valve is made of brass, and the valve spindle
and nuts of wrought iron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span> 60: <i>Slide Valve Casing, &amp;c., for Steam-engine.</i>&mdash;Draw,
half size, the views shown at (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>), fig. 58; also a
sectional plan at L M. (<i>b</i>) is an elevation of the valve casing with the
cover and the valve removed. (<i>a</i>) is a sectional elevation, the section
being taken through the axes of the steam cylinder and valve spindle.
(<i>c</i>) is a sectional plan, the section being a horizontal one through
the centre of the exhaust port. The inlet and outlet for the steam
are clearly shown in the sectional plan: in the sectional elevation
their positions are shown by dotted circles.</p>

<p>The stroke of the piston is in this case 12 inches, so that from
the dimensions given at (<i>a</i>) it must come within a quarter of an
inch of each end of the cylinder; this is called the <i>cylinder clearance</i>.</p>

<p>The piston has three Ramsbottom rings, a quarter of an inch
wide and a quarter of an inch apart.</p>

<p>The steam cylinder and valve casing are made of cast iron.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Cocks.</i>&mdash;A cock consists of a slightly conical plug which
fits into a corresponding casing cast on a pipe. Through the
plug is a hole which may be made by turning the plug to form
a continuation of the hole in the pipe, and thus allow the fluid
to pass, or it may be turned round so that the solid part of
the plug lies across the hole in the pipe, and thus prevent the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
fluid from passing. As the student will be quite familiar
with the common water cock or tap such as is used in dwelling-houses
we need not illustrate it here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 59.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 59 shows a cock of considerable size, which may be
used for water or steam under high pressure. The plug in
this example is hollow, and is prevented from coming out by a
cover which is secured to the casing by four stud bolts. An
annular ridge of rectangular section projecting from the under
side of the cover, and fitting into a corresponding recess on the
top of the casing, serves to ensure that the cover and plug are
concentric, and prevents leakage. Leakage at the neck of the
plug is prevented by a gland and stuffing-box. The top end
of the plug is made square to receive a handle for turning it.
The size of a cock is taken from the bore of the pipe in which
it is placed; thus fig. 59 shows a 2&frac14;-inch cock.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span> 61: 2&frac14;-<i>inch Steam or Water Cock.</i>&mdash;First draw the
views of this cock shown in fig. 59, then draw a half end elevation
and half cross section through the centre of the plug. Scale 6 inches
to a foot.</p>

<p>Instead of drawing the parts of the pipe on the two sides of the
plug in the same straight line as in fig. 59, one may be shown proceeding
from the bottom of the casing, so that the fluid will have to
pass through the bottom of the plug and through one side. This is
a common arrangement.</p>

<p>All the parts of the valve and casing in this example are made
of brass.</p></div>

<h2>XVII. &nbsp; MATERIALS USED IN MACHINE<br />
CONSTRUCTION.</h2>


<p><i>Cast Iron.</i>&mdash;The essential constituents of cast iron are iron
and carbon, the latter forming from 2 to 5 per cent. of the
total weight. Cast iron, however, usually contains varying
small amounts of silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, and manganese.</p>

<p>In cast iron the carbon may exist partly in the free state
and partly in chemical combination with the iron.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>white cast iron</i> the whole of the carbon is in chemical
combination with the iron, while in <i>grey cast iron</i> the carbon
is principally in the free state, that is, simply mixed mechanically
with the iron. It is the free carbon which gives the
grey iron its dark appearance. A mixture of the white and
grey varieties of cast iron when melted produces <i>mottled cast
iron</i>. The greater the amount of carbon chemically combined
with the iron, the whiter, harder, and more brittle does it
become.</p>

<p>The white cast iron is stronger than the grey, but being
more brittle it is not so suitable for resisting suddenly applied
loads. White iron melts at a lower temperature than grey
iron, but after melting it does not flow so well, or is not so
liquid as the grey iron. White iron contracts while grey iron
expands on solidifying. The grey iron, therefore, makes finer
castings than the white. Castings after solidifying contract in
cooling about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch per foot. Castings possessing
various degrees of strength and hardness are produced by
melting mixtures of various proportions of white and grey
cast irons. White cast iron has a higher specific gravity than
grey cast iron.</p>

<p>Cast iron gives little or no warning before breaking. The
thickness of the metal throughout a casting in cast iron
should be as uniform as possible, so that it may cool and
therefore contract uniformly throughout; otherwise some parts
may be in a state of initial strain after the casting has cooled,
and will therefore be easier to fracture. Re-entrant angles
should be avoided; such should be rounded out with fillets.</p>

<p>The presence of phosphorus in cast iron makes it more
fusible, and also more brittle. The presence of sulphur
diminishes the strength considerably.</p>

<p>The grey varieties of cast iron are called <i>foundry irons</i> or
<i>foundry pigs</i>, while the white varieties are called <i>forge irons</i>
or <i>forge pigs</i>, from the fact that they are used for conversion
into wrought iron.</p>

<p>Amongst iron manufacturers the different varieties of cast
iron are designated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., the lowest
number being applied to the greyest variety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chilled Castings.</i>&mdash;When grey cast iron is melted a portion
of the free carbon combines chemically with the iron; this,
however, separates out again if the iron is allowed to cool
slowly; but if it is suddenly cooled a greater amount of the
carbon remains in chemical combination, and a whiter and
harder iron is produced. Advantage is taken of this in making
<i>chilled castings</i>. In this process the whole or a part of the
mould is lined with cast iron, which, being a comparatively
good conductor of heat, chills a portion of the melted metal
next to it, changing it into a hard white iron to a depth
varying from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch. To protect the cast-iron lining
of the mould from the molten metal it is painted with
loam.</p>

<p><i>Malleable Cast Iron.</i>&mdash;This is prepared by imbedding a
casting in powdered red hematite (an oxide of iron), and
keeping it at a bright red heat for a length of time varying
from several hours to several days according to the size of the
casting. By this process a portion of the carbon in the casting
is removed, and the strength and toughness of the latter
become more like the strength and toughness of wrought or
malleable iron.</p>

<p><i>Wrought or Malleable Iron.</i>&mdash;This is nearly pure iron, and
is made from cast iron by the puddling process, which consists
chiefly of raising the cast iron to a high temperature in a
reverberatory furnace in the presence of air, which unites with
the carbon and passes off as gas. In other words the carbon
is burned out. The iron is removed from the puddling
furnace in soft spongy masses called <i>blooms</i>, which are subjected
to a process of squeezing or hammering called <i>shingling</i>.
These shingled blooms still contain enough heat to enable
them to be rolled into rough <i>puddled bars</i>. These puddled
bars are of very inferior quality, having less than half the
strength of good wrought iron. The puddled bars are cut into
pieces which are piled together, reheated, and again rolled
into bars, which are called <i>merchant bars</i>. This process of
piling, reheating, and re-rolling may be repeated several times,
depending on the quality of iron required. Up to a certain
point the quality of the iron is improved by reheating and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
rolling or hammering, but beyond that a repetition of the
process diminishes the strength of the iron.</p>

<p>The process of piling and rolling gives wrought iron a
fibrous structure. When subjected to vibrations for a long
time, the structure becomes crystalline and the iron brittle.
The crystalline structure induced in this way may be removed
by the process of <i>annealing</i>, which consists in heating the iron
in a furnace, and then allowing it to cool slowly.</p>

<p><i>Forging and Welding.</i>&mdash;The process of pressing or hammering
wrought iron when at a red or white heat into any
desired shape is called <i>forging</i>. If at a white heat two pieces
of wrought iron be brought together, their surfaces being clean,
they may be pressed or hammered together, so as to form one
piece. This is called <i>welding</i>, and is a very valuable property
of wrought iron.</p>

<p><i>Steel.</i>&mdash;This is a compound of iron with a small per-centage
of carbon, and is made either by adding carbon to wrought
iron, or by removing some of the carbon from cast iron.</p>

<p>In the <i>cementation</i> process, bars of wrought iron are imbedded
in powdered charcoal in a fireclay trough, and kept
at a high temperature in a furnace for several days. The
iron combines with a portion of the carbon to form <i>blister
steel</i>, so named because of the blisters which are found on
the surface of the bars when they are removed from the
furnace.</p>

<p>The bars of blister steel are broken into pieces about 18
inches long, and tied together in bundles by strong steel wire.
These bundles are raised to a welding heat in a furnace, and
then hammered or rolled into bars of <i>shear steel</i>.</p>

<p>To form <i>cast steel</i> the bars of blister steel are broken into
pieces and melted into crucibles.</p>

<p>In the <i>Siemens-Martin</i> process for making steel, cast and
wrought iron are melted together on the hearth of a regenerative
gas-furnace.</p>

<p><i>Bessemer steel</i> is made by pouring melted cast iron into a
vessel called a converter, through which a blast of air is then
urged. By this means the carbon is burned out, and comparatively
pure iron remains. To this is added a certain quantity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of 'spiegeleisen,' which is a compound of iron, carbon, and
manganese.</p>

<p><i>Hardening and Tempering of Steel.</i>&mdash;Steel, if heated to
redness and cooled suddenly, as by immersion in water, is
hardened. The degree of hardness produced varies with the
rate of cooling; the more rapidly the heated steel is cooled,
the harder does it become. Hardened steel is softened by the
process of <i>annealing</i>, which consists in heating the hardened
steel to redness, and then allowing it to cool slowly. Hardened
steel is <i>tempered</i>, or has its degree of hardness lowered, by
being heated to a temperature considerably below that of a red
heat, and then cooling suddenly. The higher the temperature
the hardened steel is raised to, the lower does its 'temper'
become.</p>

<p><i>Case-hardening.</i>&mdash;This is the name given to the process
by which the surfaces of articles made of wrought iron are
converted into steel, and consists in heating the articles in
contact with substances rich in carbon, such as bone-dust,
horn shavings, or yellow prussiate of potash. This process
is generally applied to the articles after they are completely
finished by the machine tools or by hand. The coating of
steel produced on the article by this process is hardened by
cooling the article suddenly in water.</p>

<p><i>Copper.</i>&mdash;This metal has a reddish brown colour, and when
pure is very malleable and ductile, either when cold or hot, so
that it may be rolled or hammered into thin plates, or drawn
into wire. Slight traces of impurities cause brittleness,
although from 2 to 4 per cent. of phosphorus increases its
tenacity and fluidity. Copper is a good conductor of heat and
of electricity. Copper is largely used for making alloys.</p>

<p><i>Alloys.</i>&mdash;<i>Brass</i> contains two parts by weight of copper to
one of zinc. <i>Muntz metal</i> consists of three parts of copper to
two of zinc. Alloys consisting of copper and tin are called
<i>bronze</i> or <i>gun-metal</i>. Bronze is harder the greater the proportion
of tin which it contains; five parts of copper to one
of tin produce a very hard bronze, and ten of copper to one
of tin is the composition of a soft bronze. <i>Phosphor bronze</i>
contains copper and tin with a little phosphorus; it has this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
advantage over ordinary bronze, that it may be remelted without
deteriorating in quality. This alloy also has the advantage
that it may be made to possess great strength accompanied with
hardness, or less strength with a high degree of toughness.</p>

<p><i>Wood.</i>&mdash;In the early days of machines wood was largely
used in their construction, but it is now used to a very limited
extent in that direction. <i>Beech</i> and <i>hornbeam</i> are used for
the cogs of mortise wheels. <i>Yellow pine</i> is much used by
pattern-makers. <i>Box</i>, a heavy, hard, yellow-coloured wood,
is used for the sheaves of pulley blocks, and sometimes for
bearings in machines. <i>Lignum-vit&aelig;</i> is a very hard dark-coloured
wood, and remarkable for its high specific gravity,
being 1<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></small> times the weight of the same volume of water. This
wood is much used for bearings of machines which are under
water.</p>

<h3><i>SCIENCE AND  ART DEPARTMENT, SOUTH<br />
KENSINGTON.</i></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Syllabus.</span></h3>

<h4>SUBJECT II.&mdash;MACHINE  CONSTRUCTION  AND<br />
DRAWING.</h4>


<p>It is assumed that the student has already learnt to draw to scale,
and that he can draw two or more views of the same object in
simple or orthographic projection. To pass in machine construction
and drawing, he must be able to apply this knowledge to the representation
of machinery. He must be acquainted with the form and
purpose of the simpler parts of which machines are built up and
must have had some practice in drawing them. To test his knowledge,
rough dimensioned sketches, more or less incomplete, of
simple machine details will be given him, and he will be required to
produce a complete drawing in pencil to a given scale. Two or
more views of at least one subject will be required, and these must
be so drawn as to be properly projected one from the other, <i>in order
to show that the student appreciates that he is producing a representation
of a solid piece of machinery, and not merely copying a
sketch. No credit will be given unless some knowledge of projection
is shown.</i> The centre lines of the drawings should be shown,
and parts cut by planes of section should be indicated by diagonal
shading. Bolts and other fastenings should be carefully shown
where required. Any indication that a candidate has merely
copied the sketches given, without understanding the part represented,
will invalidate his examination.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">First Stage or Elementary Course.</span></h4>

<p>In the elementary stage, a knowledge is required of the simple
parts only of <i>machines in common use</i>. <i>Some</i> of these are
enumerated in the following list. The student should be practised
in drawing them till he recognises their forms, and the object of the
arrangement should be explained to him. He should also know
the simple technical terms used in describing them.</p>

<p>A few very simple questions relating to the arrangement, proportions,
and strength of the simplest machine details will be set
in the examination paper.</p>

<p>In drawing the examples set to test a student's knowledge and
skill in machine drawing, it must be remembered that only a
limited time is available. It is only possible to set an example to
be drawn in pencil, and the points which will receive attention are
(1) accuracy of scale and projection; (2) power of reading a drawing,
shown by the ability to transfer portions of the mechanism
and dimensions from one view to another; (3) knowledge of
machines, as shown by the ability to fill in small details, such as
nuts, keys, etc., omitted in the sketches given. Bearing in mind
the limited time available, the student should try to make his
outline clear and decisive and complete. But the diagonal lines
necessary for sectional parts may be done rapidly, though neatly,
by freehand if necessary.</p>

<p><i>Riveted Joints.</i>&mdash;Forms of rivets and arrangement of rivets in
lap and butt joints with single and double riveting. Junction of
plates by angle and T-irons.</p>

<p><i>Bolts, Studs, and Set Screws.</i>&mdash;Forms of these fastenings.
Forms and proportions of nuts and bolt-heads. Arrangement of
flanges for bolting.</p>

<p><i>Pins, Keys, and Cotters.</i>&mdash;Form of ordinary knuckle joint. Use
of split pins. Connection of parts by a key. Connection of parts by
a cotter. Gib and cotter.</p>

<p><i>Pipes and Cylinders.</i>&mdash;Forms of ordinary pipes and cylinders
and their flanges and covers.</p>

<p><i>Shafting.</i>&mdash;Forms of shafts and axles and of journals and
pivots. Use of collars and bosses. Half-lap coupling. Box
coupling. Flange coupling.</p>

<p><i>Pedestals and Plummer Blocks.</i>&mdash;Simplest forms of pedestals
and hangers for shafts. Form and arrangement of brass steps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Arrangements for fixing pedestals and for neutralising the effects of
wear.</p>

<p><i>Toothed Gearing.</i>&mdash;Forms of ordinary spur and bevil wheels.
Meaning of the terms pitch, breadth of face, thickness of tooth,
pitch line, rim, nave, arm. Mode of drawing bevil wheels in
section.</p>

<p><i>Belt Pulleys.</i>&mdash;Forms of belt pulleys for flat and round belts.
Stepped speed cones. Drawing of pulleys with curved arms.</p>

<p><i>Cranks and Levers.</i>&mdash;Forms of ordinary cast-iron and wrought-iron
cranks and levers. Modes of fixing crank pin. Modes of
fixing crank shaft. Double cranks. Form of eccentrics.</p>

<p><i>Links.</i>&mdash;Most simple forms of connecting rod ends, open or
closed. Use of steps in connecting rods. Use of cotters to tighten
the steps.</p>

<p><i>Pistons.</i>&mdash;Simple forms of piston. Use of piston packing.
Modes of attaching piston rod.</p>

<p><i>Stuffing-Boxes.</i>&mdash;Simple form of stuffing-box and gland. Use of
packing. Mode of tightening gland.</p>

<p><i>Valves.</i>&mdash;Simple conical of puppet valve. Simple slide valve.
Cock or conical sliding valve.</p>

<p>You may take the Elementary, or the Advanced, or the
Honours paper, but you must confine yourself to one of them.</p>

<p>Put the number of the question before your answer.</p>

<p>You are expected to prove your knowledge of machinery as
well as your power of drawing neatly to scale. You are therefore
to supply details omitted in the sketches, to fill in parts left
incomplete, and to indicate, by diagonal lines, parts cut by planes of
section.</p>

<p>No credit will be given unless some knowledge of projection is
shown, so that at least two views of one of the examples will be
required properly projected one from the other. The centre lines
should be clearly drawn. The figured dimensions need not be
inserted.</p>

<p>Your answers should be clearly and cleanly drawn in pencil.
No extra marks will be allowed for inking in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>All figures must be drawn on the single sheet of paper supplied,
for no second sheet will be allowed.</p>

<p>The value attached to each question is shown in brackets after
the question. But a full and correct answer to an easy question will
in all cases secure a larger number of marks than an incomplete or
inexact answer to a more difficult one.</p>

<p>Your name is not given to the Examiner, and you are forbidden
to write to him about your answers.</p>

<p>You are to confine your answers <i>strictly</i> to the questions

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
